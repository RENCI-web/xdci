Discovery Environment is a product of CyVerse, and provides both a service API and a web interface for researchers to manage and share their research data and metadata, as well as to the ability to create, share, and run computational tools on that data seamlessly.  In collaboration with CyVerse, xDCI is taking this robust cyberinfrastructure and helping make it a generalize platform for data-driven research.
