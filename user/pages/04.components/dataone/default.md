DataONE describes itself as "a distributed network of data centers, science networks or organizations. These organizations can expose their data within the DataONE network through the implementation of the DataONE Member Node service interface. In addition to scientific data, Member Nodes can provide computing resources, or services such as data replication, to the DataONE community."  In collaboration with DataONE and CyVerse, the DataNet Federation Consortium has developed a configurable framework that can allow organizations running the xDCI infrastructure the ability to easily come up as a DataONE Member Node, allowing research data to be discovered and shared with a broader community.
