ExoGENI is a new [GENI testbed]((http://www.geni.net)) that links GENI to two advances in virtual infrastructure services outside of GENI: open cloud computing (OpenStack) and dynamic circuit fabrics. ExoGENI is, in effect, a widely distributed networked infrastructure-as-a-service (NIaaS) platform geared towards experimentation and computational tasks. Individual ExoGENI deployments consist of cloud site “racks” on host campuses, linked with national research networks through programmable exchange points.
