**What is {x}DCI?**

xDCI is a complete and customizable solution for scientific communities looking to use data cyberinfrastructure to kick start their research and accelerate the discovery process. xDCI makes team science possible by giving researchers the ability to share data securely, discover and access data at multiple locations, test hypotheses on diverse data collections, and publish and share research results.  
<br/>
<br/>
**Why use {x}DCI?**

* xDCI allows research teams to share and analyze data sets that are too large to maintain and use on computers in a typical research lab. 
* The framework uses metadata, standards and identifiers to ensure that data is discoverable and reusable for future studies.
* The data owner controls data access, eventually making it discoverable and accessible to other scientists and the public.  
* xDCI assigns Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to all data it publishes and assigns new DOIs to different versions of research data. 
* xDCI provides federation with other research archives while allowing each institution to maintain control of their data in compliance with their institutional data management policies.
